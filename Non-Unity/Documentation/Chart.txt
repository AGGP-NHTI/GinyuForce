Goofy/Spoof character driven story in 2D. Main boss with some small enemies/goons. Goons could possibly drop health or
points/gold. Dialogue will determine the choice of the player. Intermiitons between boss phases to determine dialogue.
(ex. boss will hop out from phase 1 to talk with others). Intermition dialogue can be affected by player choices.
	Serious start to joke middle.
